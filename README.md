Stock Movement Prediction Using Reddit Data
Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock market movements by analyzing discussions from Reddit. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, we scrape Reddit data (mainly from stock-related subreddits like r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets) to gauge public sentiment around various stocks. This sentiment data is then used to predict whether the stock price will rise or fall.

The project demonstrates the potential of social media data to influence stock predictions, providing valuable insights for traders and investors.
