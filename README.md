# -Stock-Movement-Analysis-Based-on-Social-Media-Sentiment
Stock Movement Prediction Using Reddit Data
Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock market movements by analyzing discussions from Reddit. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, we scrape Reddit data (mainly from stock-related subreddits like r/stocks, r/wallstreetbets) to gauge public sentiment around various stocks. This sentiment data is then used to predict whether the stock price will rise or fall.

The project demonstrates the potential of social media data to influence stock predictions, providing valuable insights for traders and investors.

Features
Reddit Data Scraping: Collects posts and comments from key stock-related subreddits such as r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets using Reddit's API.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of Reddit posts (positive, negative, or neutral) using NLP techniques.
Stock Price Prediction: Builds a machine learning model to predict stock movements based on Reddit sentiment and historical stock data.
Visualization: Provides data visualizations showing the correlation between Reddit sentiment and stock price movementsTechnologies Used
Python: The primary language for data scraping, processing, and modeling.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper): For collecting Reddit data.
NLTK / Transformers: For natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
Scikit-Learn: For building machine learning models to predict stock movement.
Yahoo Finance API: To fetch stock data for analysis and comparison.

Data Collection
Reddit Scraping:

Using the PRAW library, this project collects Reddit posts and comments from subreddits like r/wallstreetbets, r/investing, and r/stocks.
The data includes text from posts and comments, along with metadata such as the number of upvotes, downvotes, and timestamps.
The posts are filtered to focus on those mentioning specific stocks, such as "AAPL" (Apple), "TSLA" (Tesla), and others.
Stock Data:

Stock data (open, close, high, low, volume) is retrieved using the Yahoo Finance API.
The data is processed to create a feature for each stock’s daily movement, labeled as Up or Down based on the daily closing price change.
Machine Learning Model
Model Training:

Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are used to predict stock price movements (Up or Down).
The features used for training include sentiment scores, the number of comments and upvotes, and historical stock data.
Model Evaluation:

The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-validation is performed to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Feature Importance:

Feature importance is analyzed to understand which factors (e.g., sentiment, number of comments, stock volume) are most influential in predicting stock movements.
Data Visualization
Sentiment Analysis Visualization:

Word clouds are generated from positive and negative posts to show common words associated with each sentiment.
Time series plots are created to visualize the correlation between daily stock prices and sentiment scores.
Stock Price Movement vs. Sentiment:

Correlation heatmaps and scatter plots are used to explore how sentiment scores relate to stock price movements.
Visualize the trends in Reddit sentiment and compare them with real-world stock price changes.
